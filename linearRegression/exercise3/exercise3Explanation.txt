The gas turbine emissions data set was obtained from a monitoring of 11 sensor measurements aggregated for one hour, from a gas turbine located in Turkey in order to study the flue gas emissions of CO, NOx and energy efficiency (TEY).

The files gasturbine_2011.csv to gasturbine_2015.csv, contains the dataset with the independent (AT, AP, AH, AFDP,GTEP, TIT, TAT and CDP) and dependent (TEY, CO and NOx) variables.

Use the dataset to estimate the regression model to predict turbine energy yield (TEY), CO and NOx emissions using the turbine and environmental variables as characteristics.
