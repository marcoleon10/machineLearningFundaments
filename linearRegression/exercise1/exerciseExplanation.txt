Concrete is a highly complex material. The slump flow of concrete is not only determined by the water content, but is also influenced by other concrete ingredients.

The file **slump_test.dat** contains the data set which includes 103 data points. There are 7 input variables and 3 output variables in the data set. The slump_test.names file shows the input-output attribute information.

Implement a linear regression with multiple input-output variables to predict the displacement, flow and compressive strength of concrete. Estimate the unknown parameters of the regression model for the three output variables.
